options:
extend error highlighting to the full line
lighten code outside viewport

features:
pane per editor instead of window, see codeglance EditorPanelInjector

bugs:
green hover line is covered by 'current line' yellow highlight
paint 'current line' highlight (yellow by default) into preview
dragging preview rect centers instead of repositions
folded code doesnt render the green line hover highlight
only scrolls to whole lines
click/drag to scroll when pannel is scrollable
can't scroll horizontally
can't resize



optimization:
myEditor.getFoldingModel().isOffsetCollapsed(highlighter.getStartOffset()))



// TODO modifying document doesnt update outline
// increase line height to 3 for dragging
// fix scrolling
// draw folded region background
// some highlighters dont appear to be working, see main.js
// change plugin panel injection technique to be at least one level outside where it currently is since the editor is eating middle clicks
